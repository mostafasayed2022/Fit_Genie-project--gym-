                            Choose a routine that matches your current fitness level. If you're a beginner,
                            start with a program designed for beginners to avoid injury and build a solid foundation.
                            Pay attention to how your body responds to the routine. If you experience pain or discomfort,
                            adjust the routine or seek guidance from a fitness professional.

                            To achieve body recomposition, you need to maintain a slight caloric deficit
                            to lose fat while consuming enough protein and nutrients to support muscle growth.
                            Adequate protein intake is crucial for preserving and building muscle mass while in a caloric deficit.
                            Aim for around 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.
                            Incorporate resistance training into your routine to stimulate muscle growth.
                            Focus on compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups.

                            This is the number of calories your body needs to maintain basic functions at rest.
                            There are several formulas to estimate BMR, such as the Harris-Benedict equation or the Mifflin-St Jeor equation,
                            Multiply your BMR by an activity factor to estimate your TDEE.
                            The activity factor ranges from 1.2 (sedentary) to 1.9 (very active).

                            Research suggests that consuming around 20-40 grams of high-quality protein per meal is sufficient to maximize muscle protein synthesis in most individuals.
                            Consuming more protein than your body can use for
                            muscle protein synthesis at one time may result in the excess being used for energy or stored as fat.

                            The intensity of your workout should align with your fitness goals. For example,
                            if you're aiming to improve cardiovascular fitness, you might focus on activities that elevate your heart rate.
                            The duration of your workout should be appropriate for your fitness level and goals. A longer workout doesn't always mean a better workout.
                            Over time, you should see improvements in your strength, endurance, or other fitness markers.
                            Progression is a sign that your workout routine is effective.
                            Consistently engaging in physical activity is key to seeing results.
                            A single intense workout is less beneficial than a regular, sustainable exercise routine.
